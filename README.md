# DS COIN

- DS Coin is a decentralized dummy cryptocurrency programmed using Java.
- Self-implemented authenticated linked list and Merkle trees are used for building transaction blocks using CRF(SHA256) and secure storage.
- Engineered the features of initiating and validating transactions, used Merkle Trees for optimal time complexity.

**Malicious Miners:**
-  Implemented tree structure of blockchain besides linked list, to detect malicious miners in decentralized process


- Detailed description of the project can be found in the file `Project Description.pdf`.
- Example of the working model without and with malicious miners can be found in the file `workmodel example_Honest Miners.pdf` and `Workmodel example_Malicious Miners.pdf`


**Files:**
- Driver code is also added to test the project.
